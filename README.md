# Individual programming project
In this repository you can find my solutions to tasks from the "Individual 
Programming Project" course, taking place in the first year of computer science 
at MIM UW.

The tasks are written in C language.

## Labyrinth
The task was to write a program that searches for the shortest path in a 
multidimensional labyrinth. The main difficulty was checking the correctness of 
the program input and storing it properly in the computer's memory, as the 
dimensions of the labyrinth could be large.

## Phone forward
The task was to write a program to handle the operation of redirecting telephone 
numbers. As a telephone number, we considered any sequence of characters 
consisting of digits `0, 1, ... , 9` and the signs `*` and `#`. The description 
of the interface is in the file phone_forward.h, which was largely prepared by 
the author of the task. The entire module is documented in doxygen format.
